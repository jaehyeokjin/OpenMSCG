# Regression Tests

The regression tests are organized to the `pytest` framework. Please ensure you 
have the `pytest` package installed in your Python environment before doing 
regression tests. More information for `pytest` can be found 
[here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html)

### Run test

1. Go into the root folder of the OpenMSCG package (where the file`pytest.ini`
exists)

2. Run pytest

```
pytest
```
